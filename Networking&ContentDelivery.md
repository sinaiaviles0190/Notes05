# Networking and Content Delivery
## Notes 05

### Keypoints
- Networks are two or more client machines that are connected together to share resources
-  OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection) has 7 layers:
  (7)Application:  Software that is requesting or recieving network communications. This is the layer that users interact with the software app directly (eg. email, web browser)
  (6) Presentation: translates software encoding and human readable format (DOC,JPG) 
  (5) Session: Creates logical connection between the software endpoints. Creates, manages, and terminates connections between local and remote apps (HTTP (80), FTP (21) )
  (4) Transport: segments traffic for better transmission between hosts. (TCP, UDP)
  (3) Network: configures packets for intra- and inter- subnet communications. Provides the procedural means of transerring packets of data from one node to another, connected in different networks. 
  (2) Data Link: Provides node-to-node data transfer between two connected nodes (MAC Address)
  (1) Physical: Converts data into appropriate format (hubs, )
 - OSI Model demonstrates the route of communication between the network

### 7.02 Computer Networking
- Computer Network is the interconnection of multiple devices using multiple mediums to communicate between two different devices. These devices are called Network Devices ( Hub, Router, Switch, etc)
- Protocols are a set of rules that define how two networks can communicate. (eg. TCP, IP, UDP, ARP, DHCP, FTP)
- IP Address (Internet Protocol Address): network address of the system across the network
- IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) assigns IPv4 (32-bits) for each device on the Internet. Some are assigned IPv6.
