## Notes 05

### Keypoints
- Networks are two or more client machines that are connected together to share resources
-  OSI Model has 7 layers:
 - (7)Application:  Software that is requesting or recieving network communications (eg. email, web browser)
 - (6) Presentation: translates software encoding and human readable format (DOC,JPG) 
 - (5) Session: Creates logical connection between the software endpoints (HTTP (80), FTP (21) )
 - (4) Transport: segments traffic for better transmission between hosts. (TCP, UDP)
 - (3) Network: configures packets for intra- and inter- subnet communications
 - (2) Data Link: applies physcal addresses to the data, creating a switchable frame (MAC Address)
 - (1) Physical: Converts data into appropriate format (hubs, )
 - OSI Model demonstrates the route of communication between the network
 - Devices on the Internet are identified by their IP Address
